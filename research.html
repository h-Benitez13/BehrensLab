                The Behrens lab mainly focuses on dendritic cell biology and their function in normal and pathologic
                immune
                responses. In particular, we have developed an interest in Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a set of
                molecules on
                dendritic cells that recognize pathogens via common molecular motifs and initiate inflammatory
                responses.
                Within this theme of dendritic cell/TLR biology, the lab has two major arms of research:

                            <p>1) TLR signal transduction ? TLRs have classically been thought to signal cells to
                                generate inflammatory responses via two major signaling conduits, the MyD88 and TRIF
                                pathways. However, there are many modifying and regulatory pathways that intersect with
                                these tow major TLR signaling cascades. We are interested in probing the role of
                                tyrosine phosphorylation events, mediated by Syk and the adapter protein Slp-76 in
                                modulating TLR function in dendritic cells and macrophages.</p>

                            <p>2) Macrophage Activation Syndrome ? MAS is a rare, but fatal complication of a number of
                                rheumatic, oncologic, infectious, and genetic disorders. In particular, 10% of patients
                                with Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis will develop fulminant, life-threatening
                                MAS. The syndrome consists of a ?sepsis-like? clinical picture, and the pathologic
                                hallmark of the disease is the hemophagocytic macrophage. These are macrophages,
                                typically found in the bone marrow, that are phagocytosing other live hematopoetic cells
                                such as red blood cells, platelets, or leukocytes. The pathoetiology of MAS in poorly
                                understood, but is thought to be in part due to excessive CD8+ T-cell/antigen presenting
                                cell (APC) interaction, resulting in overwhelming inflammation. While the T-cell
                                determinants of this pathologic interaction have been reasonably well characterized, the
                                APC side has not. Which APC plays a role in the disease, what APC inflammatory
                                mediators, and what signal transduction pathways are critical to disease all remain
                                unanswered and are potential areas of therapeutic development. Furthermore, the
                                physiologic role of the hemophagocyte remains debated. We have developed a novel model
                                of MAS in the mouse that does not depend on a genetic mutation but rather on repeated
                                TLR stimulation, replicating the inflammatory environment seen in the rheumatic diseases
                                associated with MAS. We have identified a complex network of cytokines, including IFNg
                                and IL-10, and cell types that contribute to disease. We are currently working our the
                                regulatory mechanisms behind these cytokines and cells to both provide insight into the
                                fundamental immunology of MAS and develop novel therapeutics. We are also using
                                transcriptome analysis to investigate the function of hemophagocytes to better
                                understand their role in MAS.</p>
