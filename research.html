            The Behrens lab mainly focuses on dendritic cell biology and their
            function in normal and pathologic immune responses. In particular,
            we have developed an interest in Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a set
            of molecules on dendritic cells that recognize pathogens via common
            molecular motifs and initiate inflammatory responses. Within this
            theme of dendritic cell/TLR biology, the lab has two major arms of
            research:

                  1) TLR signal transduction ? TLRs have classically been
                  thought to signal cells to generate inflammatory responses via
                  two major signaling conduits, the MyD88 and TRIF pathways.
                  However, there are many modifying and regulatory pathways that
                  intersect with these tow major TLR signaling cascades. We are
                  interested in probing the role of tyrosine phosphorylation
                  events, mediated by Syk and the adapter protein Slp-76 in
                  modulating TLR function in dendritic cells and macrophages.

                  2) Macrophage Activation Syndrome ? MAS is a rare, but fatal
                  complication of a number of rheumatic, oncologic, infectious,
                  and genetic disorders. In particular, 10% of patients with
                  Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis will develop fulminant,
                  life-threatening MAS. The syndrome consists of a ?sepsis-like?
                  clinical picture, and the pathologic hallmark of the disease
                  is the hemophagocytic macrophage. These are macrophages,
                  typically found in the bone marrow, that are phagocytosing
                  other live hematopoetic cells such as red blood cells,
                  platelets, or leukocytes. The pathoetiology of MAS in poorly
                  understood, but is thought to be in part due to excessive CD8+
                  T-cell/antigen presenting cell (APC) interaction, resulting in
                  overwhelming inflammation. While the T-cell determinants of
                  this pathologic interaction have been reasonably well
                  characterized, the APC side has not. Which APC plays a role in
                  the disease, what APC inflammatory mediators, and what signal
                  transduction pathways are critical to disease all remain
                  unanswered and are potential areas of therapeutic development.
                  Furthermore, the physiologic role of the hemophagocyte remains
                  debated. We have developed a novel model of MAS in the mouse
                  that does not depend on a genetic mutation but rather on
                  repeated TLR stimulation, replicating the inflammatory
                  environment seen in the rheumatic diseases associated with
                  MAS. We have identified a complex network of cytokines,
                  including IFNg and IL-10, and cell types that contribute to
                  disease. We are currently working our the regulatory
                  mechanisms behind these cytokines and cells to both provide
                  insight into the fundamental immunology of MAS and develop
                  novel therapeutics. We are also using transcriptome analysis
                  to investigate the function of hemophagocytes to better
                  understand their role in MAS.
